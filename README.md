# Notepad-Clone-Java-
I've developed a Notepad clone using Java that replicates the functionality and user interface of the popular Windows Notepad application. The Notepad clone provides a simple yet effective text editing environment for users to create, edit, and save text-based documents.

Key features of the Notepad clone include:

Text Editing: Users can input, edit, and format text using standard editing functionalities such as cut, copy, paste, undo, and redo.
File Operations: Users can create new documents, open existing text files, save changes to files, and save documents.

The Notepad clone features a clean and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) with menu options, toolbar buttons, and status bar indicators for a seamless user experience. It leverages Java's Swing library for GUI components and file handling APIs for managing text files.

Overall, the Notepad clone is a versatile and user-friendly text editor that demonstrates my Java programming skills in GUI development, file handling, and text manipulation.
